The Mime package provides you with a simple interface for parsing urls and file extensions to their appropriate mime types.

## Installation

Mime is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) which is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system and automates the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Mime as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/aplr/Mime.git",
        .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")
    )
]
```

## Usage

```swift
import Mime

let url = URL(string: "file:///tmp/vienna.png")!

guard let mime = Mime(url: url) else { return }

print(mime.mime) // image/png
print(mime.ext)  // png
```
